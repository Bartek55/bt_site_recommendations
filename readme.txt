= Does this plugin make changes to my site? =

No, this plugin only analyzes your site and provides recommendations. You must manually implement the suggested changes or use other plugins/tools to apply them.

= How often should I run an analysis? =

We recommend running an analysis after making significant site changes, after installing/updating themes or plugins, or monthly for general health checks.

No, the plugin only runs analysis when you click the "Analyze" button. It doesn't add any frontend code or slow down your site for visitors.

= Can I use this with caching plugins? =

Yes! The plugin works well with popular caching solutions like WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache, and WP Rocket. In fact, we often recommend using caching plugins based on the analysis results.
